<i>Data science is the study of extracting value from data</i>. This course will introduce students to the methods and tools used in data science to obtain insights from data. Students will learn how to analyze data arising from real-world phenomena while mastering critical concepts and skills in computer programming and statistical inference. The course will involve hands-on analysis of real-world datasets, including economic data, document collections, geographical data, and social networks. This class is ideal for students looking to increase their digital literacy and expand their use and understanding of computation and data analysis across disciplines. No prior programming or math background is required.

<!-- old grading 
This is a project-based course.  Instead of exams, you will do a series of hands-on assignments and a final project.  

* Weekly assignments (45%)
* Final project (45%)
* Peer grading (5%)
* Participation (5%)

Late day policy
: To account for issues that arise in these uncertain times, each student has 10 late days for the homeworks and projects.
<br>
See the [Policies](http://localhost:4000/policies.html#late-days) for more details.
<!--
Each student has five free "late days". Homeworks can be submitted at most two days late. If you are out of late days, then you will not be able to submit your homework. One "day" is defined as anytime between 1 second and 24 hours after the homework deadline. The intent of the late day policy it to allow you to take extra time due to unforseen circumstances like illnesses or family emergencies, and for forseeable interruptions like on campus interviewing and religious holidays. You do not need to ask permission to use your late days. No additional late days are granted.
